# Code-Warrior
A game based around teaching the player to code in javascript. This is done by allowing the player to program the AI
for a warrior that has to navigate mazes in the early levels and fight monsters in the later stages. Right now, this
is more of a concept. There is a working javascript interpreter, but the levels have not been created yet.
